Note:

             	In this paper they have two samples, healthy adult kidney (single-nuclei Seq, 4259 cells) and a single kidney transplant biopsy core (single-cell Seq, 4487 cells)
,
             	Besides, they compare the epithelia between healthy- and allograft sample, so I generated 5 kinds of results:

             		healthy kidney: 4259 nucleis with 6 clusters, results with prefix 'allograft'

             		allograft kidney: 4487 cells with 16 clusters, results with prefix 'healthy'

             		combined epithelia: 4643 cells (healthy 3532 cells, allograft 1111 cells), results with prefix 'Combined-Epithelia-...'
