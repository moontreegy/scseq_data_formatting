Note: 

	The metadata got from: https://singlecell.broadinstitute.org/single_cell

	There are two datasets in this paper, WT (11 samples) and RBF mutant (3 samples), GEO provides raw counts for all samples. 

	The paper analyse the WT alone and they also combined the WT and RBF to do analyse, so they have the 2 metadata tables, one for WT and another is for combined.

	According to metadata, WT (11,416 cells) and WT_RBF (5,589 wild type cells and 5,197 Rbf mutant cells)

	I generated 4 results, one for WT using WT metadata, other 3 for combined using combined metadata
