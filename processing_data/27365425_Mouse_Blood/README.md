Note:
In this paper, they sequenced three type of cells after index sorting(progenitor, HSPC and LT-HSC). The barcode2cluster information (cell types) are given for both the broad and narrow cell type categories that were retrospectively identified using the index data. An entry of "1" in the table indicates a cell belongs to the cell type category, whereas a "0" means it does not. In the table, along with cell types that are subsets of other cell types (e.g. MPP1 and MPP), cells can belong to multiple categories.
Using their primary cell type to generate the results, and their annotations (broad and narrow) are in the file "27365425_cell2clusterAssignment_Mouse_Blood.csv".
